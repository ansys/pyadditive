Custom material tuning
======================

This example shows how to tune a custom material for use with PyAdditive.
For background information and file formats, see
`Material Tuning Tool (Beta) to Create User Defined Materials
<https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/add_beta/add_science_BETA_material_tuning_tool.html?q=material%20tuning%20tool>`_
in the *Additive Manufacturing Beta Features* documentation.
To prevent wasted time, before executing this example, carefully review
the steps described in this PyAdditive documentation.

Units are SI (m, kg, s, K) unless otherwise noted.

Perform required import and connect

Perform the required import and connect to the Additive service.

Specify tuning inputs
---------------------
The :class:`MaterialTuningInput` object contains the paths to the files needed to
tune a material. The ``experiment_data_file`` file is a CSV file containing the
results of single bead experiments. The ``material_configuration_file`` file is a JSON
file containing the material parameters. The ``thermal_properties_lookup_file``
file is a CSV file containing the temperature-dependent properties of the material.
The ``characteristic_width_lookup_file`` file is an optional CSV file containing
the melt pool characteristic width at various laser powers and scan speeds.
If the characteristic width lookup file is not specified, it is generated
during the tuning process.

Perform material tuning
------------------------
Use the :meth:`~Additive.tune_material` method to perform material tuning.

Review results
--------------
The :class:`MaterialTuningSummary` object contains the results of the material
tuning process. These results are used in follow-on steps to calculate the
material parameters needed by PyAdditive. For more information, see the
Additive documentation referred to earlier.
