2D Microstructure analysis
##########################

This example shows how to use PyAdditive to determine
the two-dimensional microstructure in the XY, XZ, and YZ
planes for a sample coupon with given material and
machine parameters.

Units are SI (m, kg, s, K) unless otherwise noted.

Select material
---------------
Select a material. You can use the :meth:`~Additive.materials_list` method to
obtain a list of available materials.

Specify inputs for microstructure simulation
---------------------------------------------
Microstructure simulation inputs can include thermal parameters.
Thermal parameters consist of ``cooling_rate``, ``thermal_gradient``,
``melt_pool_width``, and ``melt_pool_depth``. If thermal parameters are not
specified, the thermal solver is used to obtain the parameters prior
to running the microstructure solver.

Run simulation
--------------
Use the :meth:`~Additive.simulate` method of the ``additive`` object to run the simulation.
The returned object is either a :class:`MicrostructureSummary` object or a
:class:`SimulationError` object.

Plot results
------------
The ``summary``` object includes three VTK files, one for each of the
XY, XZ, and YZ planes. Each VTK file contains data sets for grain orientation,
boundaries, and number. In addition, the ``summary`` object
includes circle equivalence data and average grain size for each plane.
See :class:`MicrostructureSummary` for details.
