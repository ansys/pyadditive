   :canonical: ansys.additive.core.material_tuning.MaterialTuningInput





   Provides input parameters for tuning a custom material.


   :Parameters:

       **id: str**
           ID for this set of tuning simulations.

       **experiment_data_file: str**
           Name of the CSV file containing the experimental results data.

       **material_configuration_file: str**
           Name of the JSON file containing the material parameters.

       **thermal_properties_lookup_file: str**
           Name of the CSV file containing a lookup table for thermal-dependent properties.

       **characteristic_width_lookup_file: str, None**
           Name of the CSV file containing a lookup table for the characteristic melt pool
           width at a given temperature. The default is ``None``, in which case the characteristic
           width is calculated. However, a value must be provided for the ``base_plate_temperature``
           parameter.

       **allowable_error: float, 0.05**
           Maximum allowable error between experimental and simulated results.
           The default is ``0.05``, which is 5 percent.

       **max_iterations: int, 15**
           Maximum number of iterations to perform when trying to match
           simulation results to an experiment if the allowable error is not met.

       **base_plate_temperature: float, 353.15**
           Temperature of the base plate in Kelvin. This is only required if the
           value for the ``characteristic_width_lookup_file`` parameter is ``None``.
           This value is ignored otherwise. The default is ``353.15`` K, which is 80 C.
